# Your Project's Name
The name of this project is Weather Tracker Singapore. The aim is to consolidate data into a simpler view form, such as for rainfall,
humidity and temperatures in Singapore.


## Design Process
Most of the design process involved was that I wanted the website to be very straightforward and compiled.

- As a person who is looking to track weather data, be it for research purposes or just for personal use, I would want to be
able to view all the information closely together so that I do not have to search for each type of data individually.

- As the creator/owner of the website, I would want to display all the information as neatly as possible.

## Features
 
### Existing Features
- Tabs in the Navigation Bar to easily navigate the various forms of data representations.
- Maps embedded to view the various points likely to / or are currently raining, can also be used as an extra map for viewing
when planning trips.

### Features Left to Implement
- Search tab such that data from previous days can be obtained as well.
- Other forms of weather data, Wind-direction / Humidity
- Visual display of weather, ex. Clouds for the Rain forecast tab

## Technologies Used
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/navbar/)
    - **Bootstrap** used to make the navigation bar.
- Others include [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to program the webpage using HTML and CSS.
- As well as [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/sea/products/xd.html) which was used for the wireframes of the webpage.

## Testing

-Automated Testing
    - W3C MarkUp Validation: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fventurion18.github.io%2FID_Asg2_repo%2F

-jQuery function to change the text of the Rain forecast page doesn't change the text. Hence it appears to be empty.
